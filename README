Boiler library in conjuction with hot library is a multithreaded server environment. It gives a possibility to write potentially fast and flexible servers using single process/thread technique.

Key features:

iostream interface for sockets
transparent context switches while waiting for data (event-driven context switching)
based on Thread Pool and Reactor patterns
support for epoll and kqueue
highly configurable
Definitely works under Linux and FreeBSD.

Not documented yet. Includes server example (templates/classic_server/doller).
